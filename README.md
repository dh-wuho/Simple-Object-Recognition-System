# Simple Object Recognition System

Two algorightms are used to implement the system. Both implementations can be executed on Google Colab.

CNN is built by ourselves and it consists of 3 hidden layers and 1 fully connected layer.

Faster-RCNN uses Google object detection APIs directly as a comparison to our CNN model.
